## A brief resume

#Starting as a waiter, I was growing up with each work I've done until 
become a system administrator. But this is the real beginning.
Passionate of technology, I am continue working on improve points of my 
career, since basics, like Linux or Windows OS, passing through 
databases or network and security management, to for example, less known 
programming languages, such this webpage written in Jekyll.

#My purpose is learn and learn, and from this year, try to launch this 
webpage in a language that I don't know yet, but sharing interesting things 
I will learn in many courses or just by the way.
